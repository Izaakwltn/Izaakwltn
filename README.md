### Hello, I'm Izaak Walton

I am a self-taught programmer, passionate about learning new technologies and techniques to make new projects run. I am currently working on projects in Common Lisp, Python, and Rust.

In addition to programming, I am a violinist and mandolinist, teaching violin, viola, and mandolin. 
You can check out my musical alter-ego at [scaleyourviolin.com](http://scaleyourviolin.com).

My [twitter](https://twitter.com/skripkoder) has a mix of programming, musings, and violin posts.
